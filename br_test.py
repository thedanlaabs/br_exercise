"""
Write a smoke test to verify the functionality of the B/R home page. You may use selenium web-driver to do this.
This doesnâ€™t have to be exhaustive, but feel free to add additional ideas of what could be automated if you are
running out of time.
"""

"""
This test quickly opens the b/r homepage, checks the title, and checks that a link (NFL on the top bar) is working.
The next  bits of functionality I'd check would be to confirm an image is loading properly, then see if I could find a
date on the page to confirm I wasn't looking at something cached. Lastly, I'd mess around with the Edit Teams
functionality, but would need to go through a dummy account creation for that.

The only gotcha in my setup is that the chromedriver needs to be sitting in a folder on C:/ (or change the location
in the code below).
